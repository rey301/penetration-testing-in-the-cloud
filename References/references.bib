	abstract = {An intranet is a computer network for sharing information, collaboration tools, operational systems, and other computing services within an organization, usually to the exclusion of access by outsiders. The term is used in contrast to public networks, such as the Internet, but uses most of the same technology based on the Internet Protocol Suite.A company-wide intranet can constitute an important focal point of internal communication and collaboration, and provide a single starting point to access internal and external resources. In its simplest form, an intranet is established with the technologies for local area networks ({LANs}) and wide area networks ({WANs}). Many modern intranets have search engines, user profiles, blogs, mobile apps with notifications, and events planning within their infrastructure.
An intranet is sometimes contrasted to an extranet. While an intranet is generally restricted to employees of the organization, extranets may also be accessed by customers, suppliers, or other approved parties. Extranets extend a private network onto the Internet with special provisions for authentication, authorization and accounting ({AAA} protocol).},

Key recommendations to address these vulnerabilities are to use a secure protocol, such as {HTTPS}, for communications between a cloud user and the {OpenStack} Horizon Dashboard, to encrypt all files that store user or administrative login credentials, and to correct a software bug found in the {OpenStack} Cinder typedelete command.},

	title = {Ensuring Cloud Security Using Cloud Control Matrix},
	abstract = {Cloud computing is the most evolutionary technology prevalent today, which is widely accepted by organizations due to cost-affordability, efficiency and flexibility. It enables the virtual organization to share geographically distributed resources as they pursue common goals, assuming the absence of central location, omniscience and an existing trust relationship. It shifts the responsibility of managing a complex {IT} infrastructure by offering a simple, cost-effective and efficient way to run a business. From a security perspective, a number of unchartered risks and challenges have been introduced from relocation to the clouds, deteriorating much of the effectiveness of traditional protection mechanisms. This paper presents an overview of Cloud Control Matrix ({CCM}), created by Cloud Security Alliance ({CSA}). {CCM} acts as a baseline set of security controls to help enterprises assess the risks associated with a cloud computing provider, thus securing the cloud transition and building a trust between the cloud customer and the cloud vendor.},
